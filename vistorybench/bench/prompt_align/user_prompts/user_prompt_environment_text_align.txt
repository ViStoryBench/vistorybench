### Task Definition
You will be provided with an image and a text prompt that describes the **background**, objects, and mood of the scene (excluding characters). Your task is to evaluate the consistency between the **background and objects** described in the prompt and what is visually represented in the image.

### Evaluation Criteria

When assessing the semantic consistency between the image and the text prompt, focus on how well the **background and non-character elements** in the image match the description provided in the text. The evaluation should be based on the following aspects:

1. **Relevance**: The image should clearly relate to the primary background elements and objects described in the text. It should reflect the main setting and environment described, without introducing irrelevant or unrelated features.

2. **Accuracy**: Check if the specific details mentioned in the text are correctly represented in the image. This includes any mentioned objects, scenery, environmental conditions (e.g., weather, lighting), and relevant background elements.

3. **Completeness**: Evaluate whether the image accurately includes all critical background elements described in the text. The image should reflect the key details and setting, not leaving out essential aspects of the described background or scene.

4. **Context**: The image should maintain the context of the description. If the text describes a specific environment or atmosphere, the image must capture that context appropriately, considering the described mood and setting elements.

### Scoring Criteria

Based on these factors, the image will be assigned a score from **0 to 4**, indicating the degree of consistency between the image and the description in the text:

* **Very Poor (0)**: No correlation. The image completely fails to reflect the background or objects described in the text.
* **Poor (1)**: Weak correlation. The image touches on the background or objects in a very general sense but misses most of the important details or has significant inaccuracies.
* **Fair (2)**: Moderate correlation. The image contains some relevant background and objects, but several important details are missing or inaccurately represented.
* **Good (3)**: Strong correlation. The image accurately represents most of the described background and objects with minor omissions or inaccuracies.
* **Excellent (4)**: Near-perfect correlation. The image perfectly captures the background and objects as described in the text, leaving no significant details missing or inaccurate.
