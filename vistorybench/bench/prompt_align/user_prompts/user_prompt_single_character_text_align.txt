### Task Definition

For each evaluation, you will receive a text prompt, an image, and a character name. Your task is to **first extract the individual action or behavior of the specified character from the text prompt, then determine whether the image accurately reflects this description for that character**, and finally assign a score based on the criteria.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Extract Action Information**: Carefully extract the specific action or behavior described for the given character (character name) from the text prompt.
2. **Image Comparison**: Examine the image to determine whether the specified character’s action matches the extracted description.
3. **Analyze and Score**: Analyze the match according to the scoring criteria and assign a score.

### Scoring Criteria

Focus on the following aspects when evaluating:

1. **Relevance**: Does the image show the specified character performing the action or behavior described in the text?
2. **Accuracy**: Are the details of the character’s action in the image (such as posture, gestures, environment) consistent with the text description?
3. **Completeness**: Does the image fully depict the character completing the entire action as described, without omitting important parts?

Assign a score from 0 to 4 based on the degree of semantic consistency:

- **0 (Very Poor)**: No correlation. The image does not reflect any aspect of the described action.
- **1 (Poor)**: Weak correlation. The image only generally addresses the text, missing most details and accuracy.
- **2 (Fair)**: Moderate correlation. The image depicts the action to some extent, but with several inaccuracies or missing details.
- **3 (Good)**: Strong correlation. The image accurately portrays most elements of the action, with only minor inaccuracies or omissions.
- **4 (Excellent)**: Near-perfect correlation. The image closely aligns with the text prompt and depicts the character’s action with high accuracy and completeness.
