### Task Definition

You will be provided with an image and a text prompt describing the shot type of the image. As an experienced evaluator, your task is to assess whether the generated image meets the specified shot requirements based on the evaluation criteria.

## Additional Material

Instruction: You are a professor evaluator. Below is information about different shot types and shot distances. Please evaluate whether the generated image meets the requested shot type.

### Shot Distance Descriptions:

* **Long Shot**: Shows the relationship between characters and their environment, typically used to display the scene or environment.
* **Full Shot**: Shows the full body of a character, commonly used to display movement or the full scene.
* **Medium Long Shot**: Starts from above the character’s knees, capturing part of the environment.
* **Medium Shot**: Captures the character from the waist up.
* **Close-Up**: Captures the character from the chest up.
* **Extreme Close-Up**: Focuses on the character’s head or face, with the background and environment typically blurred or not visible.

### Angle Descriptions:

* **Eye Level Shot**: Camera is positioned at the subject's eye level.
* **Low Angle Shot**: Camera is positioned below eye level, shooting upward, emphasizing the character’s power or size.
* **High Angle Shot**: Camera is positioned above eye level, shooting downward, often minimizing the subject's significance.
* **Bird’s Eye View**: Camera shot taken from directly above, providing an overview of the scene.
* **Tilted Shot**: Camera is intentionally tilted to create a sense of imbalance or tension.
* **Perspective Compression**: A technique that emphasizes depth and the relationship between foreground and background through perspective.

### Scoring Range

A score between 0 and 4 will be assigned based on how well the shot type aligns with the content described in the prompt:

* **Very Poor (0)**: The image does not meet any shot or angle requirements.
* **Poor (1)**: The image meets some but not most of the shot or angle requirements.
* **Fair (2)**: The image partially meets the shot or angle requirements, but some elements are off.
* **Good (3)**: The image meets most of the shot or angle requirements.
* **Excellent (4)**: The image fully meets all of the shot and angle requirements.
